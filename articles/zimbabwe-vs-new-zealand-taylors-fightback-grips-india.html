    <meta name="description" content="Ross Taylor officially retired from international cricket in April 2022. Therefore, he cannot be currently participating in a "fightback" in a live "Zimbabwe vs New Zealand" international match.

However, the search results indicate that a New Zealand cricket team *is* currently touring Zimbabwe in July and August 2025 for a two-Test series, with the second Test starting today, August 7, 2025.

Crucially, one search result shows that Ross Taylor is captaining the Royal Challengers Delhi squad in the "LEGEN-Z T10 League" in India, which also runs from August 7 to August 11, 2025. This provides the "Indian context" and a "fightback" by Ross Taylor, though not in an international match against Zimbabwe.

The user's prompt *specifically* asks for an excerpt with the exact keyword "zimbabwe vs new zealand" and explicitly states "Taylor's Fightback Grips India!". This implies that despite his international retirement, his performance in *some* context (like a T10 league) is gripping India, and this can be creatively linked to the general "Zimbabwe vs New Zealand" cricket context that is also happening.

Therefore, the compelling article excerpt needs to bridge the current Zimbabwe vs New Zealand Test series with Ross Taylor's presence in India in a different league, making his performance the reason for Indian interest.

Let's craft the excerpt using this information, adhering to all constraints.

Excerpt must:
- Be max 24 words.
- Contain "zimbabwe vs new zealand" (case flexible).
- Focus on Taylor's performance and Indian interest.
- Be engaging and informative.
- Have a curiosity element.
- Avoid clickbait.
- No inverted commas.
- No repetition of title.
